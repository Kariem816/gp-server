# IoT Smart Campus

This repo contains the server side code for the IoT Smart Campus project. The project is part of courses ECE491 - Graduation Project I and ECE492 - Graduation Project II at Faculty of Engineering, Ain Shams University.

## Project Description

The project aims to build a smart campus that can be used to monitor the campus and provide useful information to the students and staff. The project is divided into three main parts:

- Embedded
- Server
- Image Processing

### Embedded

The embedded part is responsible for collecting data from the sensors and sending it to the server. The embedded part is built using Arduino and ESP8266.

### Server

The server is responsible for receiving data from the embedded part and storing it in a database. The server is also responsible for providing the data to the image processing part and the web/mobile application.

### Image Processing

The image processing part is responsible for processing the images received from the server and detecting the number of people in the image. The image processing part is built using Python and OpenCV.
